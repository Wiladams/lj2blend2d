The examples in this folder use the basic LuaJIT blend2d binding.  They should operate
in an environment agnostic of OS, and only leverage what's in the base binding.

The samples generally generate output image files, rather than display anything on the screen.
They're good for testing basic functionality, doing sanity checks, and ensuring the binding
works in very general terms.

NOTE TO SELF: Do not put anything in here that is very platform specific
